    Our mission is to transform ordinary groups into extraordinary teams by helping you lead & manage teams of all levels, all sizes, with our primary offering being teamwear.

    <p className="text-gray-400 text-base mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Managing a team is no easy feat, and we want to make this easier to allow captains and managers to focus on leading teams, rather than the administrative burdens it often comes with.
    </p>

    <p className="text-gray-400 text-base mb-4 leading-relaxed">
    Alongside your players, teams have coaches, treasurers, supporters and many more stakeholders. Over time, we aim to support all.

    <p className="text-gray-500 text-sm mt-6 italic">
      Whether you're starting a Sunday League side with mates or building a corporate crew for your company colleagues - your tribe begins here.
